Computational Drug Research
In this Jupyter notebook, we will build a real-life Biology Computational project, In the end we will be building a machine learning model using the ChEMBL bioactivity data.

During our worklfow we will use the ChEMBL Database wich  is a database that contains curated bioactivity data of more than 2 million compounds. 
It is compiled from more than 76,000 documents, 1.2 million assays and the data spans 13,000 targets and 1,800 cells and 33,000 indications. [Data as of October 25, 2020; 
ChEMBL version 26].
